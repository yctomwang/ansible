bugfixes:
- >-
  powershell - Implement more robust deletion mechanism for C# code compilation
  temporary files. This should avoid scenarios where the underlying temporary
  directory may be temporarily locked by antivirus tools or other IO problems.
  A failure to delete one of these temporary directories will result in a
  warning rather than an outright failure.
