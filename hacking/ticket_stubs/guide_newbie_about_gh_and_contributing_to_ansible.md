@{{ paste.handle.here }} it seems to me that you are new to GitHub and
have created this
[PR](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
accidentally. That's why I'm closing it.

But no worries! Welcome to the Ansible community :)

Assuming that you wanted to create actual contribution, I think that
you may want to learn and read through the following articles I've
gathered for you:

• <https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/>
• <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/>

Because this project is very active, we're unlikely to see comments made on closed tickets and we lock them after some time.

If you or anyone else has any further questions, please let us know by using any of the communication methods listed in the page below:

  <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html>

Have a nice day!
