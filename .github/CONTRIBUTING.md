# WELCOME TO ANSIBLE GITHUB

Hi! Nice to see you here!

## QUESTIONS ?

Please see the [Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html) for information on
how to ask questions on the [mailing lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html#mailing-list-information) and IRC.

The GitHub issue tracker is not the best place for questions for various reasons,
but both IRC and the mailing list are very helpful places for those things, as the community page explains best.
